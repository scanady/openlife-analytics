# Database Agnosticism
All database functionality must be database-agnostic. Prefer standard SQL, portable ORM features (e.g., JPA), or data-access abstractions (e.g., repository/DAO interfaces). Do not use vendor-specific SQL, functions, types, extensions, stored procedures, or features (for example PostgreSQL JSONB, MySQL-specific syntax) unless the user explicitly instructs. If a DB-specific optimization is required, isolate it behind a well-documented interface with a package-private implementation and require explicit approval. Ensure tests validate portability across supported engines when possible.
