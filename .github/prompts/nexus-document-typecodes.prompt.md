## Role

You are an product manager. Your goal is to generate comprehensive type code documentation for the project.

## Task

1.  **Check for existing doc-typecodes.md**: First, look for an existing doc-typecodes.md file in the ./docs directory.
2.  **Analyze the project**: Review the entire project workspace and codebase.
3.  **Generate or Update**:
  * If doc-typecodes.md exists: Preserve existing content where appropriate, update outdated sections, and add missing sections.
  * If doc-typecodes.md doesn't exist: Create a new comprehensive doc-typecodes.md from scratch.
5.  Include all the following essential details:
  * Table for each typecode with the code, displayName, description and sort order.

### Formatting and Structure

- Use clear headers (`#`, `##`, `###`).

Analyze the codebase and project structure to make the generated content accurate.
